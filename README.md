# GLOBAL-TERRORISM-ANALYSIS
### Overview
The Exploring Global Terrorism project is designed to analyze the patterns, causes, and impact of terrorism around the world. Using available data, this project aims to study global terrorism trends, including the frequency of attacks, the countries most affected, and the impact on human lives. The analysis will help identify patterns, common factors, and potential strategies for addressing terrorism on a global scale.

### Problem Statement
Terrorism is a widespread issue that disrupts societies and causes harm to individuals. Attacks can vary in scale and nature depending on the region and time period. Understanding the causes, frequency, and impact of terrorism is crucial to developing effective countermeasures and policies to prevent it.

The primary objective of this project is to analyze global terrorism data, focusing on:

- Where and when terrorist attacks occur.
- Who is involved in these incidents.
- The severity and consequences of these attacks.
Through this analysis, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of global terrorism trends and provide insights that could be used to mitigate its effects.
